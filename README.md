# OCT-Project
The latest code is in branch ```pyqt5valpha0.1```

### Resources 
Official Qt5 docs (PySide2)

Remember, we don't actually use PySide2 but [PyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/). Here are the [docs](riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/) which you may need if you run into any errors, but you should be fine with the PySide docs.
